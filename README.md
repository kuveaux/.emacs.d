.emacs.d
========

My Emacs configuration. I mostly just put it here as a convenient way to share it between my computers.

I'm using the built-in package manager to keep track of all the modes I use so the first time you launch emacs with this configuration it will ask you to install a bunch of modes.

Modes
-----

- scala-mode2: For Scala programming
- tuareg: For Ocaml Development
- clojure-mode: For Clojure development
- auto-complete: Required by merlin, but also a pretty nice minor-mode in itself.
- magit: Essential for working with git from inside of Emacs
