.emacs.d
========

My Emacs configuration. I mostly just put it here as a convenient way to share it between my computers.

I'm using the built-in package manager to keep track of all the modes I use so the first time you launch emacs with this configuration it will ask you to install a bunch of modes.

Modes
-----

- Languages
    - tuareg: For Ocaml Development
    - scala-mode2
    - clojure-mode
    - scss-mode
    - markdown-mode
- Utils
    - textmate: Bringing some of the nicer Textmate features to Emacs
    - magit: Essential for working with git from inside of Emacs
    - auto-complete: Required by merlin, but also a pretty nice minor-mode in itself.
    - sr-speedbar: Makes it possible to run speedbar in a normal buffer
    - exec-path-from-shell: Makes sure that Emacs.app uses the same PATH as my terminal
