* Index.el improvements
** If the current file isn't in the tags-table it should try to find that file.
** Also read .ctags-ignore for more patterns if it exists
** It would be great the make path's relative to the project root.

* Various Ideas
** Code completion based on English dictionary
** Implement bookmarks the way textmate has them
** Flyspell for comments, org-files, markdown?

* Python
** PEP8 if I can set it up to use our config always.
** Run tests in python (selected method, all in file, etc.)
** Make pylint-errors return stuff that I can jump to

* New packages to consider
** GIt gutter?
** smex https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex
** Full-ack https://github.com/nschum/full-ack (consider if I want to use ack)
