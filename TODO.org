* I want to cleanup the buffer on save (https://github.com/danjacka/.emacs.d/blob/master/defuns/buffer-defuns.el)

* TAGS
** How do I loop over results when there are more than one? (C-u <f3>)
** TODO If the current file isn't in the tags-table it should try to find that file.
** TODO I want to perform 'complete-tag' using IDO in the mini buffer from all definitions in the project
** TODO Also read .ctags-ignore for more patterns if it exists

* Python
** PEP8 if I can set it up to use our config always.
** Run tests in python (selected method, all in file, etc.)
** Make pylint-errors return stuff that I can jump to

* TODO Code completion based on English dictionary

* Modes to have a look at
