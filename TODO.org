* Index.el improvements
** If the current file isn't in the tags-table it should try to find that file.
** Also read .ctags-ignore for more patterns if it exists
   (maybe just define an in-memeory set of files that I care about,
   that way I could use it for my custom rgrep as well)


* Various Ideas
** Code completion based on English dictionary
** Implement bookmarks the way textmate has them
** Flyspell for comments, org-files, markdown?
** Github color theme and font

* Python
** Can I completely remove the usage of the custom python script and only use pylint cmd-args?
** Validate that it uses our pylint config.
** Run tests in python (selected method, all in file, etc.)
** Make pylint-errors return stuff that I can jump to (see epylint.py for the cmd-line-args)
** http://docs.pylint.org/ide-integration
** https://gist.github.com/ieure/302848
** Figure out a way to not index imports.

* New packages to consider
** smex https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex
** Full-ack https://github.com/nschum/full-ack (consider if I want to use ack)
